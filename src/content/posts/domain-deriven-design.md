<span style="color:orange">Every piece of software is related to some activity or interest of its users. The domain of the software is the subject matter to which the user applies the programme. Some domains involve the physical world: an airline-booking programme involves actual people boarding real planes. Intangible domains include: An accounting program's domain is money and finance. There are some exceptions to the rule that software domains have little to do with computers: A source-code control system's domain is software development.</span>

A development team must bring to bear a body of knowledge connected to those activities in order to create software that is valuable in users' activities. The depth of information necessary can be intimidating. The amount and complexity of information available might be daunting. Models are instruments for dealing with information overload. A model is a type of knowledge that has been intentionally simplified and consciously arranged. An appropriate model organises information and concentrates it on a specific topic.

A domain model is not a specific diagram. It is the concept that the diagram is meant to convey. It is more than just the domain expert's knowledge: it is a rigorously ordered and selective abstraction of that knowledge. A diagram, as well as correctly written code and an English sentence, can describe and communicate a model.
