Have you considered utilising Google Sheets as the backend for millions of users? Hey, levels.fyi did that. Even learning this astonished me.

Before upgrading to a professional backend, they began by using Google Forms and Sheets, which let them amass millions of monthly active users.
Together, let's go deep and try to understand how they managed to pull that off.

1. Add Salary Flow (Input from user).

2. Read Flow.

3. The giant Caching technique.

To be fair, they do use serverless computing, but it's noteworthy that they choose Google Sheets as their database.
Why does the backend utilise Google Sheets? 

By their own admission: "While it may seem contradictory for a site with our volume of traffic to lack a backend or fancy infrastructure, our approach to product development has always been to start small and iterate.

This enables us to move quickly and concentrate on what matters.ðŸ’¡
