<span style="color:orange">AlphaZero</span> is an RL algorithm that leverages MCTS as a policy improvement operator. It consists of a representation network f{rep} that outputs a latent representation ht of the state St; and a prediction network f{pred} that predicts the expected return (the value) vË†t and a policy (that is, distribution over the action space) Ï€Ë†t from a given latent state. The algorithm uses the true dynamics and reward when planning. MuZero38 is a model-based variant of AlphaZero that has the same representation and prediction networks, but also learns a model of the dynamics and predicts rewards, which it uses for planning. Specifically, it learns a dynamics network f{dyn} that predicts the next latent state ht k+1 and reward rË†t k+1 resulting from a transition. Note that the subscript t denotes timesteps in the real environment and the superscript k represents timesteps in the model.

On reaching a new state, AlphaZero proceeds by first encoding the state into a latent representation with the representation network. Then, the true dynamics or dynamics network (for MuZero) as well as the prediction network f pred(ht) are used to simulate several trajectories that fill out a search tree, by sampling state transitions. At each node, the actions are selected using an optimistic strategy called the predictor upper confidence tree bound32, meant to balance exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (progressing further down the subtree of the current estimate of the best action). This strategy starts out by following the predicted policy Ï€Ë†t closely, and gradually shifts towards maximizing the predicted value function. Ultimately, an action is recommended by sampling from the root node with probability proportional to its visit count during MCTS. The predicted policy is then trained to match the visit counts of the MCTS policy in an attempt to distil the search procedure into a policy such that subsequent iterations of MCTS will disregard nodes that are not promising.

AlphaZero is trained using a self-play approach, where the agent plays against itself millions of times. The agent's policy is represented by a neural network, which is trained using a technique called Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). MCTS is a search algorithm that explores the game tree and evaluates the different possible moves.

AlphaZero was able to achieve superhuman performance in Go, chess, and shogi within a few hours of training. It defeated the world champion programs Stockfish, Elmo, and AlphaGo Zero in Go, Stockfish and Houdini in chess, and Elmo and DeepZenGo in shogi.

AlphaZero is a significant breakthrough in RL research. It demonstrates that RL can be used to train agents to play games at a superhuman level. AlphaZero is also a promising approach for training agents to solve other challenging problems, such as robotics and finance.

### Here are some of the key features of AlphaZero RL:

1. Self-play: AlphaZero is trained using a self-play approach, where the agent plays against itself millions of times. This allows the agent to learn from its own mistakes and to improve its policy over time.

2. Monte Carlo tree search: AlphaZero uses Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to explore the game tree and evaluate the different possible moves. MCTS is a powerful search algorithm that can be used to find the best move in a complex game.

3. Neural network: AlphaZero's policy is represented by a neural network. Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can be used to learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

AlphaZero RL is a powerful and versatile RL algorithm that has the potential to be used to solve a variety of challenging problems. It is a significant breakthrough in RL research and is likely to have a major impact on the field.ðŸ’¡
