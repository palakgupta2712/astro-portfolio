<span style="color:orange">Let's understand the problem first. </span>

Consider many messages that are processed by an enterprise solution have multiple micro service. An order placed by a consumer, for instance, may contain multiple line items. Each line item can require the attention of a different inventory system, as stated in the description of the Content-Based Router. As a result, we must devise a method for processing an order in its entirety while still treating each order component separately.

When a message has numerous pieces, each of which might need to be processed differently, how can we process the message?

Then IBM came with unique solution- Using a Message Splitter pattern to split a large message into smaller elements for processing by one or more targets/ services.

Let's drill down the solution in 3 easy steps.

1. Enrich with Original Event.

here i am trying to split into many messages keeping original as base.

2. Change data capture into many events.

I am tying to capture the event that got triggered while any change happen in database table.

3. Splitting message/events into multiple items for other services.
