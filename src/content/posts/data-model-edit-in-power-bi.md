<span style="color:orange">Power BI allows users to modify existing data models in the Power BI service using actions such as editing relationships, creating DAX measures and managing RLS. In this experience, users can work and collaborate simultaneously on the same data model.

## Enable the preview feature.

Editing data models in the Power BI service is automatically enabled for datasets stored in My Workspace. To open the data model for datasets stored in collaborative workspaces, you must turn on the preview feature for that workspace by completing the following steps:

1. In the Power BI service, select Settings for the workspace where you want to enable the preview feature.
2. Select Advanced > Data model settings > Users can edit data models in the Power BI service (preview).
3. Select Save to see the new experience for datasets in your workspace.

## Open the data model.

### You can open the data model for your dataset in the following ways:

1. From the workspace content list, select More options (...) for the dataset and select Open data model.
2. From the datahub content list, select More options (...) for the dataset and select Open data model.
3. From the dataset details page, select Open data model.
4. rom edit mode for a report connected to the dataset, select Open data model to open the corresponding data model in another tab.

### Model data
When you open your data model you can see all the tables, columns, and relationships in your model. You can now edit your data model, and any changes are automatically saved.

## Create measures.

To create a measure (a measure is a collection of standardized metrics) select the table in the Data Pane and select the New measure button from the ribbon, as shown in the following image.

Enter the measure into the formula bar and specify the table and the column to which it applies. Similar to Power BI Desktop, the DAX editing experience in the Power BI service presents a rich editor complete with autocomplete for formulas (intellisense).

You can expand the table to find the measure in the table.
