<span style="color:orange">When I was in need of a database which can support mission-critical application, IBM DB2 came to rescue.</span>

Let's discuss about this hero in details.

IBM Db2 is a cloud-native database designed to support high-volume, low-latency transactions and real-time analytics. It gives DBAs, corporate architects, and developers a single engine to keep important applications running, store and query anything, and fuel faster decision making and innovation across your organisation. Built on decades of data security, scalability, and availability innovation, keep your apps and analytics secure, highly performant, and resilient anywhere.

First thing first, when i talk about mission-critical application, let's see what offering from DB2 i have used most extensively.

Db2 is really powerful and scalable database that can be used for a variety of applications, including:

1. Online transaction processing (OLTP)
2. Online analytical processing (OLAP)
3. Data warehousing
4. Big data analytics
5. Hybrid cloud deployments

## Db2 offers a wide range of features, including:

1. ACID transactions
2. High availability and disaster recovery
3. Scalability and performance
4. Security and compliance
5. Advanced analytics

At this time, I am pretty sure you are interested to see a sample query, let's see.

```
SELECT * FROM employees; 
```

This query will select all rows from the employees table.

Here is another sample query that selects the first name and last name of all employees who are from the United States:

```
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE country = 'United States'; 

```

You can also use the WHERE clause to filter the results of a query. For example, the following query selects all employees who have a salary greater than $100,000:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000; 
```

You can also use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results of a query. For example, the following query sorts the results of the previous query by the employee's last name:

```
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 100000
ORDER BY last_name; 

```

These are just a few examples of sample queries in IBM DB2. There are many other types of queries that you can use, depending on your specific needs.

The deployment options DB2 provides 

Cloud-managed service: Deploy Db2 as a fully managed, SLA-backed service on IBM CloudÂ® and Amazon Web Services. Take advantage of on-demand scaling, continuous updates and consumption-based billing in the cloud. 

Cloud-managed container: Deploy Db2 as a container on cloud-managed Red Hat, OpenShift or Kubernetes services on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure and integrate Db2 into your cloud solution. 

Self-managed infrastructure or IaaS: Deploy Db2 as a container on cloud-managed Red HatÂ® OpenShiftÂ® or Kubernetes services on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure and integrate Db2 into your cloud solution.

## Some of the key features of DB2:
1. Relational model: Db2 is a relational database, which means that data is stored in tables. Tables are made up of rows and columns, and each row represents a single record.
2. ACID transactions: Db2 supports ACID transactions, which guarantee that data is always consistent and accurate.
3. High availability: Db2 can be configured to provide high availability, so that applications can continue to run even if there is a database failure.
4. Scalability: Db2 can be scaled to meet the needs of even the most demanding applications.
5. Security: Db2 offers a wide range of security features to protect data from unauthorized access.
6. Advanced analytics: Db2 supports advanced analytics, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Some of the benefits of using IBM Db2:
1. It is a mature and reliable database with a long history of success.
2. It is a powerful and scalable database that can handle even the most demanding applications.
3. It offers a wide range of features, including ACID transactions, high availability, and security.
4. It is available on a variety of platforms, including on-premises and cloud.

## Some of the limitations of using IBM Db2:

*It can be complex to set up and https://www.linkedin.com/redir/invalid-link-page?url=manage%2eIt can be expensive, especially for enterprise deployments.It is not as widely supported as some other RDBMSs, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.*

Overall, IBM Db2 is a good choice for businesses that need a powerful and reliable database for their mission-critical applications. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and limitations before making a decision.
