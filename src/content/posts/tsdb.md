A time series database (TSDB) is a database that is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data. Time-stamped data is data that is associated with a specific time, such as sensor readings, financial data, or website traffic data.

TSDBs are typically used for applications that need to ingest, store, and analyze large volumes of time-stamped data in real time. For example, TSDBs are often used in IoT applications, DevOps monitoring, and financial analytics.

1. **Time-stamped data**: TSDBs are designed to store data that is associated with a specific time. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, such as sensors, financial markets, and website traffic logs.
2. **Scalability**: TSDBs are designed to scale horizontally, meaning that they can be easily scaled up or down to meet the needs of the application.
3. **Performance**: TSDBs are optimized for fast insertion and retrieval of time-stamped data.
4. **Compression**: TSDBs can compress time-stamped data very efficiently, which can save a lot of storage space.
5. **Query language**: TSDBs typically have a specialized query language that is designed for querying time-stamped data.

TSDBs are typically used for applications that need to ingest, store, and analyze large volumes of time-stamped data in real time. For example, TSDBs are often used in IoT applications, DevOps monitoring, and financial analytics.

### Here are some of the key benefits of using a TSDB:

1. **Scalability**: TSDBs can easily scale to handle large volumes of data, making them ideal for applications that need to ingest and analyze data in real time.
2. **Performance**: TSDBs are optimized for fast insertion and retrieval of data, which is essential for applications that need to make quick decisions based on data.
3. **Compression**: TSDBs can compress data very efficiently, which can save a lot of storage space. This is especially important for applications that need to store large amounts of historical data.
4. **Query language**: TSDBs typically have a specialized query language that is designed for querying time-stamped data. This makes it easy to analyze data and identify trends and patterns.

### Some popular TSDBs include:
1. InfluxDB
2. Prometheus
3. TimescaleDB
4. ClickHouse
5. Real life Example

A simple SELECT statement(s) for InfluxDB are:

```
SELECT <field_key> FROM <measurement> 
```

This statement will select all rows from the specified measurement and return the specified field. For example, the following statement will select all values of the temperature field from the weather measurement:

```
SELECT temperature FROM weather 

```

You can also use the SELECT statement to select multiple fields or tags. For example, the following statement will select the temperature and humidity fields, as well as the location tag, from the weather measurement:

```
SELECT temperature, humidity, location FROM weather

```

You can also use the WHERE clause to filter the results of a SELECT statement. For example, the following statement will select all values of the temperature field from the weather measurement where the location tag is equal to San Francisco:

```
SELECT temperature FROM weather WHERE location = 'San Francisco' 
```

You can also use the ORDER BY clause to sort the results of a SELECT statement. For example, the following statement will select all values of the temperature field from the weather measurement, ordered by decreasing temperature:

```
SELECT temperature FROM weather ORDER BY temperature DESC 
```
Here are some more examples of simple SELECT statements for InfluxDB:

```
SELECT * FROM cpu_usage
SELECT memory_usage, cpu_usage FROM server_monitoring
SELECT temperature, humidity, pressure FROM weather WHERE location = 'New York City'
SELECT average(temperature) FROM weather GROUP BY location
SELECT max(cpu_usage) FROM server_monitoring WHERE server_name = 'webserver1' 

```
InfluxDB also supports a number of more advanced SELECT statements, such as those that use aggregation functions, subqueries, and joins. For more information, please refer to the InfluxDB documentation.

Here are some examples of how TSDBs are used in the real world:

1. **IoT applications**: TSDBs are often used to store and analyze data from IoT devices, such as sensor readings, temperature data, and location data. This data can be used to monitor the performance of devices, identify potential problems, and optimize operations.
2. **DevOps monitoring**: TSDBs are also used to monitor the performance and health of IT systems and applications. This data can be used to identify and troubleshoot problems quickly, and to ensure that systems are performing optimally.
3. **Financial analytics**: TSDBs can be used to store and analyze financial data, such as stock prices, currency exchange rates, and bond yields. This data can be used to identify trends and patterns, develop trading strategies, and make investment decisions.
4. **Scientific research**: TSDBs are also used in scientific research to store and analyze data from experiments and simulations. This data can be used to make new discoveries, develop new theories, and improve existing products and services.ðŸ’¡
